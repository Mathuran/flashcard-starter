# Frontend Interview Challenge

This is a frontend starter repo (NextJS + Tailwind + TypeScript). Your task is to build a flashcard quiz interface, similar to Quizlet.

## The Challenge

Build a simple flashcard tool with the following requirements:

### Core Requirements

1. **Card Display**: Show a single card centered on the screen. It should display the question initially.

2. **Interaction**: Clicking the card should "flip" it to reveal the answer.

3. **Game Logic**: Below the card, provide two buttons: "Got it" and "Missed it".
   - Clicking either button moves to the next card
   - Track the user's score

4. **Summary**: When all cards are finished, show a summary screen with the final score and a "Restart" button.

### Phase 1 & Beyond

This is just Phase 1. Feel free to expand however you'd like — we want to see what direction you'd take the project.
